Please note: This is a snapshot before a hardware failure caused me to
lose code. Probably should have uploaded to Github earlier before I
lost all the really cool stuff.

  This project is rather aptly named (in my opinion) because it
  depends on a bluetooth master, otherwise it is pretty much useless.

  For example, this version of the code is pretty much a remote
  display for the master. Whatever is supposed to be displayed is sent
  encapsulated in JSON. Added on top of this is some cool animation
  interpolation stuff that I am actually pretty proud of.

  Might not be in the best of shape, but the code compiles. I'll
  probably get around to uploading the schematics one day too.

  Next project should really start off on here from the start, don't
  want to suffer another embarrassment like this again...
